# Turbomachinery
 Turbomachinery analisys using python. The goal of this project is to implement Fluid Mechanics equations to analyse Turbomachines. Some book exercises will be solved.

turbopython.py contains the basic equations/functions to solve the problems
10_x_fox.py is the code used to solve the problem 10.x
